    <h3 id="preview">Preview</h3>
    <p>You purchased and downloaded Quick? Then, you probably want to also see it working live in your browser.
        There are a few things you need to do before getting started:</p>
    <h3 id="svg-injector">SVG Injector</h3>
    <p>We use a a fast, caching, dynamic inline SVG DOM injection library in order to keep the HTML markup clean.
        Because of this, you will need to run a local web server so it can work properly:</p>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        <strong>Development tip</strong>: The dynamic injection process uses AJAX calls to load SVG. If you are
        developing locally without running a local webserver, be aware that default browser security settings may
        block these calls.
    </div>
    <p>Use one of the options below to open a local web server:</p>
    <h3 id="localhost">Localhost</h3>
    <p>If you already have a set up development server, then you can simply copy and paste Quick within the
        directory. After that, you should be able to access it in your browser via <code class="highlighter-rouge">localhost</code>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="gulp">Gulp</h3>
    <p>Donâ€™t have an already set up development server. No worries! you can start a server using Gulp. Read more
        about the <a href="build-tools.html">build tools</a> in our docs. This will start server that can be
        accessed via <code class="highlighter-rouge">http://localhost:3000</code> automatically and also watch for
        any changes you might make.</p>
